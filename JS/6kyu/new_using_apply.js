  * TODO: new operator is evil because it produces a highly coupled code,

  * the construct() function. This function receives a constructor function
  * and possibly some arguments and it returns a new object constructed with
  * the function and the passed arguments.
  * This is another way to create the greeting object:
  *     var greeting = construct(Greeting, 'John');
